sineramp  - Generates sine on a ramp colour map test image

The test image consists of a sine wave superimposed on a ramp function The
amplitude of the sine wave is modulated from its full value at the top of the
image to 0 at the bottom.

The image is useful for evaluating the effectiveness of different colour maps.
Ideally the sine wave pattern should be equally discernible over the full
range of the colour map.  In addition, across the bottom of the image, one
should not see any identifiable features as the underlying signal is a smooth
ramp.  In practice many colour maps have uneven perceptual contrast over their
range and often include 'flat spots' of no perceptual contrast that can hide
significant features.

```
Usage: img = sineramp(sze, amp, wavelen, p)
       img = sineramp()

Arguments:     sze - (rows, cols) specifying size of test image.
                     Defaults to (256 512)  Note the number of columns is
                     nominal and will be ajusted so that there are an
                     integer number of sine wave cycles across the image.
               amp - Amplitude of sine wave. Defaults to 12.5
           wavelen - Wavelength of sine wave in pixels. Defaults to 8.
                 p - Power to which the linear attenuation of amplitude,
                     from top to bottom, is raised.  For no attenuation use
                     p = 0.  For linear attenuation use a value of 1.  For
                     contrast sensitivity experiments use larger values of
                     p.  The default value is 2.
```
The ramp function that the sine wave is superimposed on is adjusted slightly
for each row so that each row of the image spans the full data range of 0 to
255.  Thus using a large sine wave amplitude will result in the ramp at the
top of the test image being reduced relative to the slope of the ramp at
the bottom of the image.

To start with try

```
  > img = sineramp()
```
This is equivalent to

```
  > img = sineramp((256 512), 12.5, 8, 2)
```
View it under 'gray' then try the 'jet', 'hsv', 'hot' etc colour maps.  The
results may cause you some concern!

If you are wishing to evaluate a cyclic colour map, say hsv, it is suggested
that you use the test image generated by circlesineramp().

See source code comments for more details on the default wavelength
and amplitude.

    The Default Wavelength:
    The default wavelength is 8 pixels.  On a computer monitor with a nominal
    pixel pitch of 0.25mm this corresponds to a wavelength of 2mm.  With a monitor
    viewing distance of 600mm this corresponds to 0.19 degrees of viewing angle or
    approximately 5.2 cycles per degree.  This falls within the range of spatial
    frequencies (3-7 cycles per degree ) at which most people have maximal
    contrast sensitivity to a sine wave grating (this varies with mean luminance).
    A wavelength of 8 pixels is also sufficient to provide a reasonable discrete
    representation of a sine wave.  The aim is to present a stimulus that is well
    matched to the performance of the human visual system so that what we are
    primarily evaluating is the colour map's perceptual contrast and not the visual
    performance of the viewer.

    The Default Amplitude:
    This is set at 12.5 so that from peak to trough we have a local feature of
    magnitude 25.  This is approximately 10% of the 256 levels in a standard
    colour map. It is not uncommon for colour maps to have perceptual flat spots
    that can hide features of this magnitude.

circlesineramp - Generates a test image for evaluating cyclic colour maps

```
Usage: (img, alpha) = circlesineramp(sze, amp, wavelen, p, hole)
       (img, alpha) = circlesineramp()

Arguments:     sze - Size of test image.  Defaults to 512x512.
               amp - Amplitude of sine wave. Defaults to pi/10
           wavelen - Wavelength of sine wave at half radius of the
                     circular test image. Defaults to 8 pixels.
                 p - Power to which the linear attenuation of amplitude,
                     from outside edge to centre, is raised.  For no
                     attenuation use p = 0.  For linear attenuation use a
                     value of 1.  The default value is 2, quadratic
                     attenuation.
              hole - Boolean flag indicating whether the test image should have
                     a 'hole' in its centre.  The default is true, to have a
                     hole, this removes the distraction of the orientation
                     singularlity at the centre.
Returns:
                im - The test image.
             alpha - Alpha mask matching the regions outside of of the
                     circular test image that are set to NaN.  Used if you
                     want to write an image with these regions transparent.
```
The test image is a circular pattern consistsing of a sine wave superimposed
on a spiral ramp function.  The spiral ramp starts at a value of 0 pointing
right, increasing anti-clockwise to a value of 2*pi as it completes the full
circle. This gives a 2*pi discontinuity on the right side of the image.  The
amplitude of the superimposed sine wave is modulated from its full value at
the outside of the circular pattern to 0 at the centre.  The default sine wave
amplitude of pi/10 means that the overall size of the sine wave from peak to
trough represents 2*(pi/10)/(2*pi) = 10% of the total spiral ramp of 2*pi.  If
you are testing your colour map over a cycle of pi you should use amp = pi/20
to obtain an equivalent ratio of sine wave to circular ramp.

The image is designed for evaluating the effectiveness of cyclic colour maps.
It is the cyclic companion to sineramp().  Ideally the sine wave pattern should
be equally discernible over all angles around the test image.  In practice
many colourmaps have uneven perceptual contrast over their range and often
include 'flat spots' of no perceptual contrast that can hide significant
features.  Try a HSV colour map.

Ideally the test image should be rendered with a cyclic colour map using
showangularim() though, in this case, rendering the image with SHOW or IMAGESC
will also be fine because all image values lie within, and use the full range
of, 0-2*pi.  However, in general, default display methods typically do not
respect data values directly and can perform inappropriate offsetting and
normalisation of the angular data before display and rendering with a colour
map.

For angular data to be rendered correctly it is important that the data values
are respected so that data values are correctly assigned to specific entries
in a cyclic colour map.  The assignment of values to colours also depends on
whether the data is cyclic over pi, or 2*pi.  SHOWANGULARIM supports this.
